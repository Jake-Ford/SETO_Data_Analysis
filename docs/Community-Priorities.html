<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Solar power is the fastest <a
href="https://www.c2es.org/content/renewable-energy/#:~:text=Renewables%20made%20up%20nearly%2020,the%20fastest%2Dgrowing%20electricity%20source.">growing</a>
renewable energy source. Community shared solar (CSS) projects lower the
barrier to entry. This is accomplished by increasing the applicant pool
by allowing those without rooftop access, such as renters or those in
apartment buildings, and by lowering the financial burden of entry, as
the fixed costs to install and operate the solar panels are
collectivised rather than focused on one rooftop. CSS programs that are
third-party owned and have participants subscribe to ongoing payments.
Typically, within these programs, customers are given predefined,
discrete contract terms rather than being able to compare multiple
offerings or select their own terms. Our research is attempting to mimic
this approach by giving customers a randomly assigned contract and
surveying them on their willingness to adopt this program.</p>
<p>For potential customers, community solar contracts vary by their
contract attributes. These include term length, cancellation fees, and
potential savings rates relative to traditional utility bill companies.
Given the importance of both the solar industry and the relatively
incipient community solar industry, a dearth of research exists on how
potential customer priorities are reflected in the likelihood of
contract adoption.</p>
<p>This research seeks to fill this gap by developing quantitative
measurements of community priorities in likelihood of contract adoption.
An original data set comprised of potential community solar customers
surveyed was collected. Along with respondents demographic information,
draft contracts with varying degrees of contract attributes were shown
to each participant and their contract adoption rates. Using a weighted
logit model, the likelihood of contract adoption was analyzed by
including predictors for various demographic data and contract
attributes. Additionally, relative importance is through a multinomial
logit model, allowing contract attributes and demographic information to
be interpreted in predictive strength relative to respective reference
groups.</p>
<div id="literature-review" class="section level2">
<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<p><strong>to-do: to be added/folded into the Introduction to frame the
macro-scope of this study</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>The community solar priorities research consists of an analysis of
survey data in which each respondent was asked to evaluate two
hypothetical community solar contracts with varying contract terms.
Respondents also answered a number of demographic questions.</p>
<p>The contracts that respondents reviewed varied along the following
features: (1) the program’s savings rate compared to the typical monthly
electricity bill, (2) the program’s cancellation fee, (3) the contract
term’s length in years, and (4) the page length of the contract.</p>
<p>In addition to basic descriptive analyses, the goal is to conduct two
distinct analyses using the survey data. The primary analysis will use a
logit model to estimate respondents’ stated willingness to enroll in the
contracts they reviewed, controlling for available demographic
characteristics. The secondary analysis will use an order multinomial
logit model to estimate respondents’ stated willingness to enroll in a
contract based on various contract terms as measured by a 5-point Likert
scale.</p>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>Survey respondents were drawn from two sources: (1) members of the
Qualtrics panel (“the Qualtrics sample”), and (2) individuals in
community groups identified by Solstice (“the Community Group sample”).
Combined, these two surveys represent the primary data source. Survey
responses were collected in the Qualtrics sample from April 2021 to June
2021, and resulted in 1,261 individual responses. To expand the survey
population, the Community Group sample was collected from December 2021
to June 2022, with 1,022 responses. Total responses resulted in 2,283.
Response quality was measured in order to detect fraud or errant
submissions. After this prophylactic step, a total of 1,493 unique
individuals remained, with a total of 2,986 responses as each individual
reviewed two contracts.</p>
<p>To make sure that enough of the respondents are from populations of
interest, both of these data sources oversampled low-income respondents
and people of color. To avoid biased estimates as a result of the
overweighting in the survey design, survey weights are devised using
state level ACS data for race. Weights are available as well for income,
however due to the dynamic surveying of income used in the design of the
survey weighting was opted for just race controls. Please reference the
<a
href="https://jake-ford.github.io/SETO_Data_Analysis/survey_weights.html">survey
weights</a> section for additional information.</p>
<p>The population for this component of our research is adults (18+) in
the eight states we will include within this study: Massachusetts, New
York, California, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland, Colorado and Minnesota. We
have chosen to oversample-populations that are considered low- to
moderate-income (LMI) defined as up to 50% and between 50%-80% of an
area’s median income, in accordance with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development’s (HUD) definitions of each <a
href="https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/acs-low-mod-summary-data/">term.</a>.
Dynamic surveying was deployed in which respondents are asked whether
their income falls within the LMI ranges that correspond with their zip
code and household size. This is the preferred approach for this
research as it allows for comparing priorities across broad income
categories and avoid non- response issues attached to asking respondents
to self-attest their income levels. We have also chosen to oversample
minority and renter populations in this research, surpassing the
proportional estimates of these demographics supplied by the 2020
American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. We have designed this
sampling scheme to center familiarity with community solar as a core
demographic within this research, though we will not weight on this
demographic due to lack of an applicable metric. By centering
familiarity with community solar as a central demographic within this
research, Solstice plans to incorporate respondents that are the likely
next adopters of community solar and respondents from populations that
are not currently effectively reached by community solar. All
demographic information will be self-attested through the community
solar priorities research survey.</p>

<div id="descriptive-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
<p>Table 1 shows the summary statistics for both the demographic and the
contract attribute data. Contract varying terms such as savings rate,
cancellation fee, contract pages and contract years were evenly divided
so as to evaluate contract adoption rate relative to contract
differences. Contracts were randomly assigned to responsees to review.
The statistics below show how in aggregate, the distribution of contract
attributes remained similar to their construction.</p>

<div id="demographic-comparison" class="section level2">
<h2>Demographic Comparison</h2>
<p>Demographic data as reported in Table 1 reflects the oversampling of
LMI, minority and renting communities. Graphs 1-3 show the proportion of
each of these oversampled demographic categories in comparison totals.
For race and income, comparison data is taken for the 8 state region
from the 2020 5-year American Community Survey. Given the dynamic
sampling used for income categories, control totals for income is taken
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Policy
Development and Research (PD&amp;R) Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy Data (CHAS). The most recent CHAS data is available as of <a
href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html">2018 5-year
data</a>.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<p>A number of independent variables will be used for both contract
attributes and demographic data. Interaction variables will be tested
for significant, along with a initial stepwise regression to determine
which variables to initially include. The below equation is a summary of
the full model used in this analysis. The dependent variable is a binary
variable for contract adoption, <span

contract was adopted and 0 signifies it was not.</p>

<li>Contract lenght remained a constant deterrance</li>
<li>Homeowner status, rent vs homeowner, was not observed as a
statistically significant effect on signup rate. Likely some
multicollinearity due to effect (sign) varying from model 2 to model
4.</li>
<li>After including familiarity and reviewed dummies, savings rate
becomes statistically significant effect on likelihood of contract
adoption.</li>
<li>More familiar with community solar implies significantly more likely
to adopt contract (suggests importance of education) - odds ratio of
&gt;4 in model 3 and 4</li>
<li>In looking at contract adoption by race, Hispanics were the only
group observed with a statistically significant effect in models 1 and
2. Relative to white, hispanic rates were higher. This effect is negated
after additional IVs are introduces in models 3 and 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Table 1, four models are presented analyzing changes in
probability of sign up. Controlling for all other variables, contract
length and income were found to have statistically significant effects
on the rate of sign up. Contract length was found to have a strong
negative impact on probability of contract adoption. For example,
holding all variables constant, from model 2 we see that the odds ratio
for contract length of 25 years is 0.782, meaning the group with
contracts of 25 years are 0.782 times as likely as the group with
contracts of 1 year of signing up, or a 21.8% decrease in odds of
signing up.</p>
<p>Interestingly, lower income respondents were much less likely to
adopt the contract, even when controlling for savings rate, contract
length and number of pages, and cancellation fees. High income and
medium income respondents were 1.3 and 1.7 times the odds to adopt the
contract compared to low income respondents, controlling for contract
attributes.</p>
